  <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<strong><br>

  <p>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  <br>[2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
  [3] This separation can improve content accessibility; <br>provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br>
  enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
  and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
